Your task is to extract a structured coaching rubric from this transcript. The rubric should capture the key teaching points, benchmarks, and evaluation criteria from the tutorial.

## Input Format

## Output Format
Respond with a JSON object matching this structure:

## Guidelines
1. Be specific with timings when mentioned (convert MM:SS to seconds)
2. If timing is a range, use the middle or note the flexibility
3. Extract actual mistakes mentioned, not generic ones
4. Include decision points where the tutorial discusses adaptations
5. Mark null for benchmarks not mentioned in the video
6. Keep the rubric actionable - a player should be able to follow it

## Important
- Only include information explicitly stated or clearly implied in the transcript
- Do NOT invent benchmarks or strategies not discussed
- If the transcript is unclear or incomplete, note this in the overview
